Aim to balance detailed analysis with diverse perspectives.\n2. **Ensure Inclusivity:** Give priority to participants who have not yet spoken, ensuring that all voices are heard.\n3. **Avoid Redundancy:** Prevent the discussion from becoming repetitive. Avoid selecting speakers who are likely to echo the same opinions or repeat previously stated points.\n4. **Embrace Digression:** Allow the conversation to naturally diverge from the original topic if it leads to a more engaging and insightful discussion.\n\nThe goal is to foster a dynamic and thought-provoking dialogue."
